                    <h2>Butterflies</h2>
                    <p>Butterflies are winged insects from the lepidopteran suborder Rhopalocera, characterized by large, often brightly
                    coloured wings that often fold together when at rest, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the
                    superfamilies Hedyloidea and Papilionoidea
                    </p>

                    <p>Caterpillars are the names given to the larvae of both butterflies and moths. They are usually very distinctive, and in
                    some cases may be identified more easily than the adults. When they are developing, their skin may be shed four or more
                    times, with each molt often changing the coloration and appearance of the caterpillar. They eat voraciously to transform
                    plant material into tissues that they will need for metamorphosis.
